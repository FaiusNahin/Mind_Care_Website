Use “I” phrases instead of “you” statements. For example, say “I feel hurt when you do X” instead of “You’re wrong for doing X.” “When couples take turns being active listeners, it boosts healthy communication skills as well as conflict resolution skills for the couple,” Louis says.",

As a therapist, I believe that most conflicts can be worked out, whether you are married or divorced. During times of stress it is important to find good healthy social support through friends and family that are neutral and who only want the best for all those involved.  If you have gone through a divorce, or are going through a divorce I would recommend divorce counseling during the divorce, separation or mediation and post divorce to rebuild and move forward.",
